# Sign Language Learning Application

### Overview
Communication is a crucial aspect of daily life. For individuals with hearing and speech impairments, sign language serves as a primary means of communication, allowing them to interact with the world around them. However, learning sign language can be challenging due to limited access to resources and lack of interactivity, making the learning process less effective and engaging.

To address these challenges, we have designed **SignEase**, a technology-based application that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to assist individuals with hearing and speech impairments in learning sign language. By using gesture recognition technology, SignEaser provides an interactive and enjoyable learning experience for its users.

 **SignEase** is a machine learning-powered application designed to assist individuals with hearing and speech impairments in learning sign language. The application utilizes video classification to interpret sign language gestures and provides users with interactive lessons and feedback. By leveraging machine learning algorithms,  SignEase aims to make learning sign language accessible, engaging, and effective

### Topic and Motivation
This project focuses on using image classification to recognize and classify American Sign Language (ASL) gestures. It features an interactive interface where users can practice ASL gestures and receive immediate feedback on accuracy. Quiz features are available for users to test their understanding.

The application aims to enhance ASL education by leveraging image classification technology, making learning more accessible for individuals with hearing and speech impairments. It seeks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ASL learning for all users interested in sign language education.

The motivation behind  SignEase stems from the desire to bridge the communication gap for individuals with hearing and speech impairments. Sign language is a vital form of communication for this community, yet resources for learning can be limited and inaccessible. By developing a machine learning application that teaches sign language in an engaging and interactive manner, we aim to empower individuals with hearing and speech impairments to learn and communicate effectively.

Cooperate with one another in goodness and righteousness, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression. And be mindful of Allah. Surely Allah is severe in punishment. – **(Q.S Al-Maidah: 2)**


### Target User Group
This platform allows users to practice ASL gestures with real-time feedback using image classification technology for precise recognition. It caters to users of all ages and backgrounds seeking to enhance communication skills and learn sign language effectively. Features include quizzes and resources for reinforcing ASL proficiency, offering immediate feedback to aid improvement.

### Proposed Solution

#### Product Branding
The product will be branded as "SignEase," symbolizing its goal of making sign language communication easier and more accessible for everyone.

#### Description
Summary:
SignEase provides a comprehensive platform for learning sign language, offering interactive lessons, quizzes, and practice exercises. It uses machine learning to interpret users' gestures, offering real-time feedback and personalized suggestions. With gamification elements and tailored learning paths, SignEase makes sign language learning engaging, effective, and enjoyable.

#### How This Project Relates to SDGs
This project aligns with several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including:
- Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being, by improving communication access for individuals with hearing impairments.
- Goal 4: Quality Education, SignEase promotes inclusive and equitable education by providing accessible resources for individuals with hearing and speech impairments to learn sign language..
- Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities, By facilitating communication and understanding for individuals with hearing and speech impairments, SignEase contributes to reducing inequalities and promoting social inclusion.
